My goal with this project was to design, build, and learn to play a rim-blown flute based on the Anasazi flutes found in the American Southwest. The original idea sprung from a chance encounter with whistles made from elderberry wood which led down a rabbit hole into full blown flute making.

Hollowing out the elderberry branch was relatively simple as the center is a soft pith. However, before I could tune a rim-blown flute, I first needed to teach myself how to play one. I had played the viola for several years but had never played a wind instrument.

Based on a small initial prototype, I found the higher notes easier to produce. So, I made several intermediate-sized prototypes as I experimented with hole placement and worked on developing my embouchure. After a swap in playing styles from vertical to oblique and many hours of practice, I managed to reliably produce the root note of the flute I wanted to make my final product. For the hole placement on the final flute, I used modified ratios of hole placement to flute length of the flutes found by archeologists in broken flute cave.

After about 5-6 months of research, prototyping, and testing, I had a rim-blown flute that I could play reasonably well. And, while not perfectly in tune, it had recognizable intervals and a good sound. The following link is to a google photos album with more pictures of the process and footage of me playing the flute.
